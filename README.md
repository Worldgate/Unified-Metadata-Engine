# Unified Metadata Engine

A free, community-driven system for indexing, tagging, and optionally converting multimedia files (video, audio, games, etc.).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To create a metadata indexing and distribution engine that:
- Works across media types (movies, TV, music, podcasts, audiobooks, games)
- Uses hashes to avoid duplicate work
- Provides daily JSON metadata dumps
- Supports command-line and automation workflows
- Optionally enables file conversion and tagging

---

## 🧩 Core Features (MVP)

- 🔍 **Cross-media indexing** of file tracks and structure
- 🏷️ **Track tagging** (language, type, commentary, chapters, etc.)
- 🔐 **Hash-based file identification** for accuracy
- 📦 **Daily JSON dumps** for local sync and offline use
- 🖥️ **CLI indexing tool** to extract and write metadata
- 🔄 **Smart container conversion** with proper settings (e.g., MKV → MP4)
- 📁 **Optional metadata embedding** in file containers

---

## 🌱 Planned Features

- 🪞 **Mirror nodes** that sync metadata via dumps
- ☁️ **Cloud sync** with Dropbox, Google Drive, S3, etc.
- 📊 **Watch tracking** and history logs like Trakt
- 👥 **Friends and social sharing** (opt-in only)
- 📽️ **Video reviews & reactions**
- 🎙️ **Custom dub tracks / MS3K-style overlays**
- 🕹️ **Game and ROM indexing support (e.g., Redump, TOSEC)**
- 🔧 **User-configurable share settings** (bandwidth, time, space)
- 🧾 **Metadata moderation** (community review/approval system)
